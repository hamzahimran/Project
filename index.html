                <h2>Learn How to design a Website.</h2>
                <p>Web design encompasses many different skills
                   and disciplines in the production and maintenance
                   of websites. The different areas of web design
                   include web graphic design; interface design; authoring,
                   including standardised code and proprietary software;
                   user experience design; and search engine optimization.
                   Often many individuals will work in teams covering different
                   aspects of the design process, although some designers will
                   cover them all.</p>
                   <p>The term web design is normally used to describe the design
                    process relating to the front-end (client side) design of a
                    website including writing markup. Web design partially overlaps
                    web engineering in the broader scope of web development.
                    Web designers are expected to have an awareness of usability
                    and if their role involves creating markup then they are also
                    expected to be up to date with web accessibility guidelines.</p>

                            <p>Outsourcing your web development needs is one of the best
                               decisions you can make. It will save you time and money
                               and will ensure that you get the best services possible
                               with remarkable results.</p>
                            <p>If you have been keen on web development, you may have
                               realized that it is more than simply writing a few lines
                               of codes and customizing themes. You have to account for
                               how your users access your content, and how you rank on
                               search engines. With there being so many moving parts,
                               levering on the teamwork at a web design office is the sound thing to do.</p>

                            <p>If your company’s website needs an overhaul—or
                               if you don’t have a site yet at all—managing the
                               project can be intimidating. After all, your site is the
                               core of your online presence, and it needs to be an accurate
                               reflection of what your company has to offer.</p>
                            <p>But before you can do any work on the site, you need
                                to have a plan in place. So if you’re working on a
                                redesign or building a new site from the ground up,
                                your website planning process should involve the steps we mention below.</p>

                            <h3>Why is Web Design Important?</h3>
                            <p>It can be difficult to understand why most businesses
                               are willing to pay top dollar for web design work.
                               After all, having a functional website matters more
                               than how it looks, right? Unfortunately, this isn’t the
                               case. Today, the most important aspect of an online business
                               presence is the web design.</p>
                               <p>This means that businesses should always try
                                to find the best web styles that work for their businesses.
                                Although there are several people who can create websites,
                                it takes a skilled person to design a website that looks
                                polished and functional. Here are some more reasons why</p>

                            website is to choose a web hosting provider (if you already have a web domain1).
                            The web hosting provider provides the web space (i.e. special computers
                            called web servers) where your website files are stored, as well
                            as the technologies and services needed for your website to be viewed on the Internet.
                            <p>Add-on services provided by a web hosting provider typically include
                               data backup, firewall protection, technical support, email services,
                               domain name registration, website building tools, and applications.</p>
